	<h1 style="text-align: left;">Comparison of RELAX-NG and DSD</h1>
	<h2>Nils Klarlund</h2> 
	<h3>August, 2002</h3> 

	<p>We published DSD (Document Structure Description) 1.0 in
1999, see <a
href="http://www.brics.dk/DSD/announcements.html">announcement</a>, as
a proposal for a general, expressive, and simple schema language.  At
that time the <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/SchemaXM">Schema
notation</a> seemed to be sinking under the weight of self-generated
complexity.  (In the end, it floated, but for a lot of people its
design is still hard to appreciate; for a more cheery outlook, see <a
href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/06/19/vdv-wxs.html">Can XML Be The
Same After W3C XML Schema?</a>.)
	</p>

	<p>Spurred by motivations similar to ours, the <a
	    href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/spec-20011203.html">RELAX
	    NG NG schema language</a> was developed by James Clark and
	    Makoto Murata, based on their respective work on <a
	    href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/trex/">TREX</a> and
	    the earlier RELAX notation, which appeared around the time
	    of DSDs.  Both notations rely on the theory of tree
	    automata for unranked trees (those whose nodes may have a
	    varying number of children).  The same can be said about
	    DSDs.  However, we chose a processing model that results
	    in an unambiguous top-down parsing.  RELAX NG is
	    officially sanctioned by OASIS, the Organization for the
	    Advancement of Structured Information Standards, and
	    published as a specification in 2001.  The RELAX NG
	    notation is in some aspects very similar to DSDs.  
	</p>

	<p>But before we explain this, there is a crucial concept to
	    be digested: that of an <em>element identifier</em>.  You
	    might think that since XML is self-describing, the type of
	    any element is determined directly by its name.  But this
	    is often not the case: tag names are reused in different
	    situations, where they denote different types of
	    information.  Thus different uses are denoted by different
	    identifiers, which is a concept known by many other names:
	    a <em>type</em> (as in XML Schema or in XDuce), a
	    <em>nonterminal</em> (as in parsing), or an <em>automaton
	    state</em> (as in the theory of finite-state machines).
	    For examle, we may have a type <em>l</em> of <tt>name</tt>
	    element that contains simply a string and another type
	    <em>m</em> that contains the children named
	    <tt>forename</tt> and <tt>surname</tt>, which in turn
	    contain strings.  Content expressions are not in general
	    regular expressions over element names, but regular
	    expressions over element identifiers (or type names,
	    nonterminals or states).  For example,
	    (<em>l</em>,<em>m</em>) would be a DTD-like syntax for
	    content consisting of a <tt>name</tt> element of type
	    <em>l</em> followed by one of type <em>m</em>.  (Both
	    RELAX NG and DSD allow content expressions to work
	    directly on element names as well through minor technical
	    tricks.)  Each element identifier <em>l</em> is associated
	    with a content expression <em>C<sub>l</sub></em>.  For
	    example, the identifier <em>k</em> might be associated
	    with the element name <tt>addressbook</tt> and a content
	    expression of (<em>m</em>)*.  The usage of these content
	    expressions is expected one: if a node in the tree is
	    assigned identifier <em>l</em>, then the children of the
	    node must be assigned a sequence of identifiers
	    <em>l<sub>1</sub></em>, ...,<em>l<sub>n</sub></em> that is
	    matched by the content expression <em>C<sub>l</sub></em>
	    such that the identifier <em>l<sub>i</sub></em> is
	    associated with the name of the <em>i</em>th child.
	    Moreover, the root of the tree must be associated with an
	    <em>initial identifier</em>.  This subset of identifiers
	    corresponds to the start symbols of a grammar, or the set
	    of initial state automaton.  If such an assignment of
	    identifiers is possible to the tree of XML document, then
	    the document is set to be <em>valid</em>.  Regarded as
	    types, we can regard the initial identifiers as the set of
	    possible types of the document.  Usually, the set will
	    consist of a single identifier.
	</p>
	<p>Now back to RELAX NG and DSD: the RELAX NG notion of
	  pattern, the ability to relate attribute occurrences and
	  content, the combine mechanism (for patching grammars by
	  enlarging them or restricting them), the ability to
	  distinguish between elements that have the same name but
	  different identifiers, and the use of content expressions on
	  element identifiers are all very similar.  The notion of
	  validity is the same.  But that is one labels element nodes
	  with identifiers of element definitions are the same with
	  one crucial difference.
	</p>
	
	  <h3>Parsing or guessing</h3>

	  <p>RELAX NG uses a parsing process that is inherently
	    nondeterministic.  For this reason, schema languages can
	    be defined with RELAX NG that cannot be defined by DSDs,
	    such as the language of XHTML documents that contain at
	    least one <tt>form</tt> element.  Intuitively, the problem
	    is that a deterministic parser cannot guess where in the
	    document the <tt>form</tt> element is if it works from the
	    top towards the leaves.  </p> <p>On the other hand, RELAX
	    NG in general does not enjoy a feature essential to many
	    schema uses: for any tree of a valid XML document, the
	    schema determines an unambiguously determined element
	    identifier for each node. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In fact, it is natural in practice to specify only one
	    possible type name for an element that occurs in a content
	    specification of a parent element.  Although, it is often
	    the case that an element, say <tt>name</tt>, may in fact
	    correspond to two different types in the same document as
	    we just saw, these different uses are usually marked by
	    different ancestor elements that deterministically direct
	    the parsing and type assignment.  So, we would not
	    normally expect a content expression like (<em>l</em> |
	    <em>m</em>).  But RELAX NG allows such expressions,
	    together with multiple initial identifiers.  In this way,
	    tree automata that represent a kind of global constraint
	    satisfaction problem on the whole tree: a solution can be
	    computed only by backtracking over the whole tree or by an
	    automata-theoretic subset construction that is
	    deterministic but works from the leaves towards the roots,
	    tracking the subset of identifiers that of possible that
	    each node.  This process can probably only be understood
	    by someone who has a very good understanding of automata
	    theory or formal semantics.  As a conceptual tool of
	    modeling, tree automata---even as expressed as concisely
	    as in RELAX NG---are a bold proposal indeed.
	  </p>
	  <p>Moreover, the tree automaton technique prevents the
	    document from being processed in an on-line fashion: the
	    whole document must be read before it can be processed.
	  </p>
	  <p>The variations on the degree of determinacy in schema
	  languages for XML have been characterized in "<a
	  href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/murata00taxonomy.html">Taxonomy
	  of XML Schema Languages using Formal Language Theory</a>".
	  In particular, DTDs are very restrictive since they
	  correspond to <em>local grammars</em>, where an element name
	  is associated to a unique identifier.  In other words, the
	  type of the element is unique determined by the element
	  name.  DSDs are more liberal.  All
	  <em>restrained-competition tree grammars</em> can be
	  expressed (and some more, but that is a technical point
	  related to the greedy parsing strategy used in DSDs).
	  Intuitively, such grammars assign unambiguously an
	  identifier according to a content expression.  Actually, the
	  technical condition is quite simple: whenever a content
	  expression matches therefore,
	  they can be understood in an operational and intuitive way:
	  deterministic, top-down parsing.
	  </p>

	  <p>Importantly, it is possible to analyze a RELAX NG
	    specification automatically to determine whether it is a
	    restrained-competition grammar.  (This is a question of
	    analyzing the finite-state automaton on identifiersthat
	    correspond to the content expression.  The analysis is
	    carried out for each expression.)  Thus, a very useful
	    subset of RELAX NG exists: those schemas that enjoy
	    restrained-competition are conceptually much more in line
	    with the notion of types for trees
	  </P>

<h3>Defaulting</h3>
	    RELAX NG is designed on the fundamental premise that
	      <em>defaulting</em> and other changes to the document
	      that is being described is undesirable. DSDs take the
	      exact opposite stance.  The schema itself provides a
	      useful harness for default insertion <em>a la</em> CSS
	      (which is declarative notation much more succinct than
	      programming languages such as XSLT).  Moreover,
	      according to the DSD view (and that of say XML Schema),
	      there is essential information in the schema, such as
	      regarding white space, that should be passed on to the
	      application.

    <h3>Grammar calculus</h3>
    RELAX NG contributes a mechanism
    for <em>copying</em> grammars.  Whenever a grammar is
	      included, it is represented not as itself, but as a
	      copy.  Thus, a grammar may be refined in ways that do
	      not interfere with each other.  We could not find a way
	      of formulating such a mechanism that did not seem too
	      complicated.  The RELAX NG solution is probably as
	      simple as can be imagined in a grammar-based approach.
	      The DSD solution to the problem is not as general, but
	      often workable: it stipulates that variations of a
	      grammar occur in different contexts (as understood by
	      the position in the document explained by the path from
	      the root).  The postings in xml-dev starting with this
	      <a
	      href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/200202/msg00155.html">example</a>
	      explain some differences.
	    </li>
	    <li>DSDs provide a <em>validity mechanism</em> that imposes additional
	      constraints on declared elements of attributes.  For example, various
	      intricate relationships can be imposed on content that is declared in
	      constraints extraneous to their declaration.  In this respect, DSDs
	      resemble the <a href="http://www.ascc.net/xml/resource/schematron/schematron.html">Schematron approach</a>.

<h3>Context expressions</h3>
	      DSDs provide <em>context expressions</em> that characterize positions
	      or elements in the document without the labeling process implicit in
	      grammar approaches and XML schemas.  In this labeling process, a
	      type, category, or nonterminal name is assigned to each element.
	      DSDs represent very much a grammar approach as well, but the need to
	      invent names for various uses of the same element name can sometimes
	      be reduced drastically by instead characterizing their occurrences
	      through context expressions.

<h3>Other differences</h3>

	    <br/> <p>There are some other differences as well: DSDs do not use the
	      mathematical semantics for regular expressions describing content (as
	      does almost no tool), whereas RELAX NG is strict in this regard (and
	      better so for purposes of analysis).  DSDs use Boolean logic to
	      connect attribute occurrences and content for greater expressive
	      power, but the use of regular expressions also for attributes in RELAX NG
	      simplifies the syntax.  The DSD mechanism for mending grammars is more
	      primitive, but more expressive, than the combine mechanisms of RELAX NG;
	      for example, in DSDs a constraint (pattern) may be generalized and
	      later restricted.  It is also worth noticing that the need to
	      distinguish between constraints and content expressions in DSDs result
	      from the possibility of validation of declared content and attributes.
	      The distinction between constraint and element identifiers
	      (references), however, is conceptually important in both languages,
	      but it has been syntactically eliminated in RELAX NG.  Finally, DSDs do
	      not treat namespaces, because their meaning had not been determined
	      when we published the DSD definition.</p>

	    <p>In conclusion, RELAX NG represents in the main, and apart from the
	      copy mechanism, DSD concepts in refined and simplified forms.  The
	      simplifications have taken away some definitional and expressive
	      power, but resulted in a notation that is an excellent compromise
	      between usability and complexity.  With the support of OASIS and a
	      growing number of tools, RELAX NG should be the first schema language
	      considered for any application.
