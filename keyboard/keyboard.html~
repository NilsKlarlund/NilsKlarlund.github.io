    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      A keyboard design that better supports scrolling is presented.
      A rubber belt, or similar traction mechanism, is placed along the
      side of a keyboard so that it can be operated easily in a
      multitude of ways, including being pushed by the hand, while it is
      being supported by both the table and the belt, or being pushed by
      fingers that grab protrusions on the belt.
    </p>
    <p>Moreover, it is proposed that the belt be placed in an angle of
      say 20 degrees from the vertical so that it can be better
      manipulated with the hand resting on the table next to the side
      of the keyboard.  Also, it is proposed that mouse buttons and
      common keys may be placed below or above the belt, perhaps at an
      angle of say 20 degrees from the horizontal, so as to facilitate
      common operations.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, a rearrangement of the keys of the usual keyboard
      layout is suggested so that the total width of the keyboard design does
      not exceed that of the already wide standard 101-key keyboard.
      The rearrangement entails placing the numeric keypad above the
      arrow keys, which are placed according to the traditional
      arrangement.  The editing and window manipulation keys usually
      found above the cursor keys are moved to the right side of the
      keyboard, where they can better be manipulated by a hand resting
      on the table, especially if placed at an angle of say 20 degrees
      from the horizontal.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      The recent popularity of the scroll wheel, invented by
      Microsoft, is unfortunate from a computer ergonomics point of
      view.  The scroll wheel is used to page up and down in a window
      -- a common operation since more and more people are reading
      information directly from the screen.  But many computer users
      already suffer from injuries related to mouse use, so it is
      worrisome that this function is now being standardized as
      belonging on the mouse.
    </p>
    <p>In the present disclosure, it is suggested that the scroll
      functionality be placed on the keyboard as a belt or continuous
      tread, made out of rubber or plastic, which largely increases
      the available surface for hands and fingers to grasp.
    </p>
  
  
    <h2>Overview
    </h2>
    <img src="scroll-keyboard.gif"/>
    <p>
      The new keyboard design is shown in Figure 1.  The main claim of
      the invention is the existence and placement of a belt (which
      could also be a continuous tread similar in shape to those found
      on Caterpillar vehicles) along one or both sides of the keyboard
      so that the movement of the belt, via a connection to a
      computer, results in a proportional movement of some object
      displayed on the screen (such as the part of the document shown
      (scrolling) or cursor or sliding control (e.g. for volume)).</p>

      <p>In figure 1, the placement of the belt is shown to the left
      of the keyboard according to the top view indicated.  The belt
      may also be placed to the right, or perhaps on both sides of the
      keyboard.  The front view shows that the belt may be placed at
      an angle so that it can be better operated when the hand rests
      on the table beside the keyboard.  This side view shows how the
      belt may be fastened to two wheels, labeled Wheel A and Wheel B.
      In addition, a set of roller pins (not shown) may be used to
      support the belt between the two wheels.  The belt may be made
      out of a variety of materials, in rubber as one piece, or in
      plastic or metal, where separate pieces of material are hinged
      together to form a flexible band.  It is envisaged that the belt
      be equipped with protrusions so that a finger may
      easily grasp the belt.  A mechanism for measuring the rotation
      of a wheel (or roller pin), like the one used in scroll mice
      [roller-mouse], is used to communicate the movement of the belt
      to a computer.
    </p>

    <p>The design also postulates a new arrangement of the right hand
      side of the keyboard.  This arrangement is independent of the rest
      of the innovation, and may be useful on its own.  A small number
      of keys are suggested to be made "low-profile"; this means that
      the key is not as high as surrounding keys and that its footprint
      is smaller -- this is a common technique employed on laptop
      computers.  </p>

    <p> The purpose of the new arrangement of the keyboard is to make
      it less wide.  It is proposed to keep the cursor keys to the
      right of the main area of the keyboard that comprises the
      alphabetic keys (along with modifiers and some special keys,
      like the "insert" key).  But the usual six keys ("insert",
      "delete", "home", "end", "page up", and "page down") above the
      arrow keys ("left", "right", "up", and "down") are removed.
      Instead -- and this is main claim of the keyboard arrangement
      proposition of this invention -- the area above the arrow keys
      is used for a numeric keypad, which is usually found all the way
      to the right of the keyboard.  Moreover, the numeric keypad is
      slightly changed from the usual layout in the preferred
      embodiment so that the four keys corresponding to the usual
      arithmetic operations are placed in a column next to the
      standard 11 keys representing the 10 digits and the decimal
      point.  It is proposed that a distance of the size of a standard
      key separates the cluster of keys constituting the numeric
      keypad and the "up arrow" of the arrow keys.  In that way, the
      right hand may rest in the area around the arrow keys.
    </p>

    <p>It is further proposed that the "delete" key is moved to the
      area above the "backspace" key and that the "insert" key is moved
      to a place right above the "delete" key, perhaps in a low-profile
      version.  Similarly, it is suggested to make the rarely used keys
      "print screen", "scroll lock", "num lock", and "pause" into
      low-profile keys.  The resulting space reduction will enable the
      numeric keypad to be kept at the proposed distance from the arrow
      keys without extending the depths of the keyboard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, it is proposed to move some or all of the keys
      ("insert", "delete", "home", "end", "page up", and "page down")
      to the far right hand side of the keyboard, so that they can be
      placed in a column along the side.  That enables a user of the
      keyboard to easily manipulate these commonly used keys while
      resting part of the hand on the table.  Such arrangements are
      already present on existing laptop computers.
    </p>
    <p>Note that the present proposition for rearranging some common
    keyboard keys is entirely independent of the scroll belt idea.  It
    is of independent interest is the purpose is to keep the
    functionality of the common keyboard, which has slightly more than
    100 keys, while making it is wide.
    </p>
    
    <p>To make the mouse buttons operable with pointing devices that
      possess no built-in buttons, it is suggested to place mouse
      buttons along the sides of the keyboard.  In particular, we
      claim that a placement next to the scrolling mechanism is new
      and useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make buttons and scrolling mechanisms more easily used with
      hands resting on the table, it is suggested in this invention to
      make the area next to the side of the keyboard slope down
      towards the table as opposed to horizontal.  For example, the
      slope may be 30 degrees from the horizontal.  In that way, the
      scrolling mechanisms and the buttons close to the edge may
      easily be depressed by a hand that is close to or resting on the
      table.  Alternatively, buttons on the surface of the scrolling
      mechanisms may be shaped with oblique angles to achieve a
      similar effect.
