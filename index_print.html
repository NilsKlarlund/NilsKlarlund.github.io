	      In my Ph.D. thesis, I argued that infinite computations
	      that involve liveness are best understood as limits of
	      finite ones.  The finite approximations are
	      characterized by a progress value.  For various levels

      <h2 xmlns="">My workspace: speech recognition     and foot keyboard</h2>
        
        <p>My computer workspace is an unusual one.  It is designed
	  with the goal of virtually eliminating the usual physical
	  strain on fingers, hands, and arms.  Therefore, the use of
	  these body parts must be drastically reduced—something that
	  no amount of tinkering with keyboard or mouse design can
	  achieve.  The other goal is that the reassigned workspace be
	  more efficient the conventional one; otherwise, there is no
	  incentive to start working in different ways.  These goals are
	  usually regarded as irreconcilable.  Attempting to solve
	  the problem, I have been motivated by a typing injury (for
	  that story see <a href="ctd-rsi.html">CTD-RSI</a>).
	</p>
        <p>
	  After ten years of trial and error, I believe that I have
	  found a promising approach.  The solution is not
	  commercially available.  And, I don't know to which extent
	  my ideas apply in general for the many people who are unable
	  to use the keyboard and mouse in the intensive way
	  necessitated by modern jobs.
	</p>
        <p>My low-impact workspace concept integrates three user
	  interface ideas:
	  <ul>
      <li>replace the keyboard with speech recognition for
	      dictation and editing;
	    </li>
            <li>defer repetitive work to foot pedals; and
	    </li>
            <li>replace the mouse with a buttonless pointing device
	      that is pushed around on a large surface.
	    </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The physical expression of this concept can be seen in this picture:
	  <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img width="450" alt="Photo of workspace, showing rest area for hands,    buttonless mouse, and foot pedals." src="photos/workspace.jpg"/>
            <br/>
            <a href="photos/workspace.jpg">Click here for
	      larger picture.</a>
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>The video demos demonstrate how composing a letter is a
	  breeze with speech recognition and how repetitive tasks are
	  accomplished easily by foot work.  

	  <ul>
      <li>The video <a href="video/letter-fast.avi">ShortTalk for composing a
		business letter (streaming AVI format)</a> [<a href="video/letter-fast.mpg">mpeg-1 version</a> (12Mb)]
	      shows how speech recognition serves two roles efficiently:
	      that of automated transcription into a text editor and
	      that of editing the resulting text through the use of <a href="ShortTalk/index.html">ShortTalk</a>.  The editing
	      commands of ShortTalk are those words that sound unusual:
	      they must be different from English, since that is the
	      only way to <em>fluently</em> mix dictation and commands
	      (otherwise, how would the machine know what is what?).
	      ShortTalk is several times more efficient than the
	      so-called natural language commands of commercial
	      dictation systems.
	    </li>
            <li> The video <a href="video/footkeyboard.wmv">foot
		keyboard</a> (WMW, streaming Windows Media) [<a href="video/footkeyboard.mpg">mpeg-1 version</a> (28Mb)]
	      shows how all the keys that are commonly used for repetitive
	      tasks can be activated by feet through a foot rest
	      surrounded by switches.  The foot keyboard effectively
	      complements speech recognition, since it relieves the
	      voice of tiring work for which it is not suited.  For more
	      information, see <a href="input_devices/index.html">Input
		devices: a usage-driven approach.</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>With the techniques illustrated in the videos, it is
	  possible to work while leaning backwards in a relaxed
	  manner, since hand work and finger work has been reduced to
	  just occasionally pushing the mouse around.  Therefore, the
	  workplace puts less stress on neck and back as well.
