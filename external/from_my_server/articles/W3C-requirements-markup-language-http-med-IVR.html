<H2>Abstract</H2> <em>Voice browsing</em> involves access to the Web
via a device, such as a telephone, that has no display.  Our joint
experience with markup languages for IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
systems suggests that HTML cannot be easily extended in ways that
would make voice browsing possible.  In fact, voice browsing suffers
from many of the same obstacles that make so many IVR systems
unpleasant and difficult to use.  Web contents should nonetheless be
accessible to voice browsing communities.  This goal can be achieved
by a structured markup language that is expressly designed for IVR
services.  Such a language could be used to create voice browsers
along with Web applications that parallel their visual counterparts.
We offer some requirements for such a language.
</DIV>

<H2>
Introduction</H2> It is possible to browse the Web even in the absence
of a usable display device.&nbsp; The term <I>voice browsing</I> has
been used to describe this form of Web access, which is
characterized by the use of sound to render documents in an
interactive fashion.&nbsp; Voice browsers offer Web access to the
visually impaired, to those whose eyes must be focused on something
other than a computer screen (automobile drivers), and to those using
inherently limited terminal devices (payphone users).&nbsp; That is to
say, an effective voice browser would be a valuable tool for many user
communities.&nbsp; There have been several efforts to support the
voice browsing of arbitrary Web documents;&nbsp;&nbsp; most approaches
allow modifications to the underlying document for a more
effective voice rendering.&nbsp;&nbsp; [<A
HREF="#genMagic">1</A>,&nbsp;<A HREF="#prodWorks"> 2</A>, <A
HREF="#Rutgers">3</A>].

<P>A voice browser (or <I>voice user agent</I> in Web parlance) must
perform audio rendering and must also provide user input mechanisms
that control hyperlink selection, form field entry, and form
submission.&nbsp; Perhaps the simplest known terminal device that
supports audio browsing is the common analog telephone.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Telephones have, in fact, long supported automated information and
transaction systems, known in the telecommunications industry as
<I>Interactive Voice Response</I> (IVR) systems.&nbsp; It is therefore
natural to propose an architecture where IVR systems become voice
browsers that are defined by Web applications.&nbsp; Indeed, a
recently circulated note on voice browsing [<A HREF="#vbnote">4</A>]
describes functionality that is applicable to IVR services as well as
to browsing for the visually impaired.&nbsp; The idea that IVR systems
and Web browsers are closely related suggests that HTML should form a
basis for IVR systems.&nbsp; If the details of this idea can be worked
out, IVR systems will be created as Web applications, and Web
applications will be accessible to voice browsing communities.

<P>In this paper, we examine the requirements for markup-language-based
IVR service creation. The three groups represented by the authors of this
paper have had extensive experience in providing HTTP-mediated IVR systems,
and we believe this experience is relevant to the voice browsing community
in two ways. We have found that an approach to voice browsing and IVR based
on the extension of HTML has some important limitations.&nbsp; We have
also found the insights derived from experience with IVR systems may be
valuable in guiding the design of voice browsers.

<P>It is easy to imagine that any structured document written in a
markup language can be translated in a straightforward way to some
state machine that correctly renders the output and gathers
appropriate user input;&nbsp; indeed, such a translation is at the
heart of several HTTP-mediated voice service languages developed at
AT&amp;T [<A HREF="#att">5</A>], Lucent [<A HREF="#att">6</A>], and
Motorola [<A HREF="#motorola">7</A>].&nbsp; From this perspective,
voice browsing appears to be straightforward <span> a straightforward
problem </span> .&nbsp; However, if voice browsing is seen as&nbsp;
IVR, then it is hard to imagine how voice browsing will be any easier
to achieve than it is to create IVR services .&nbsp;
Indeed, most would agree that few IVR
services are effective and pleasing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if one assumes
that speech recognition and synthesis technology have become so
reliable that they are no longer the limiting factors in designing
effective IVR services, experience shows that the complexity of
dialogs and interactions can overwhelm a programmer not skilled in
both concurrent systems and human-computer interfaces.&nbsp; Any
service creation environment, whether or not based on HTML, must
reflect the fact that IVR service design is a complicated process that
can be parameterized in countless ways.

<P>
We believe, however, that effective IVR service creation based on Web
authoring is achievable. A structured markup language is a convenient
way to hide hardware complexities, to abstract away the difficulties
of concurrent programming, and to codify proven principles of IVR
design.  Thus, a markup language allows the designer to concentrate on
the essential matter: the contents, choice of pre-defined dialogs, and
associated help menus and prompts. The details of all of these
aspects, and the way in which they fit together, must be customizable
by the service creator (or, perhaps, the style designer).

<P>We believe it is unlikely that extensions to HTML such as those
proposed in [<A HREF="#vbnote">4</A>] will satisfy all of the
requirements for effective IVR services. The designer's intent with
regard to voice interactions is simply not well supported by such an
approach. We conclude that IVR service creation can best be achieved
with a specific markup language for specifying interactive voice
rendering. It seems to us that many of the same issues apply to the
voice browsing problem, and that such a markup language can provide a
useful substrate for voice interaction with existing Web content,
especially as voice customization becomes more prevalent.
<H2>
Phones as Web terminals: some striking problems</H2>
The starting point for this discussion is the assumption that a service
is presented as a sequence of pages of some markup language (e.g., an XML
dialect). We also assume that any activity that requires intensive computation
or access to private data is executed on the HTTP server. However, each
page may nonetheless represent complex user <I>interactions</I>, during
which multiple pieces of information are presented to and collected from
the user. These interactions take place via the limited interface provided
by a telephone, and are are strikingly different from those of typical
visual browser. This section covers some of the differences, and it discusses
the consequences for service specification.
<H3>
Documents must be rendered along a temporal dimension</H3>
In the visual world, a full screen of any document may be presented at
a given moment. The two-dimensional layout of the document is determined
through style sheets or flow-objects. The reader can instantaneously select
the part of the information that he or she wants to read; in fact, the
effort of intra-page navigating is so negligible that it is usually unconscious.
In the voice world, information is rendered linearly, as a function of
time. Thus the analog of layout is a description of the interactive, temporal
process where the listener selects, through prompts and barge-ins, what
linear fragments of the document to render.
<H3>
It is not possible to separate content from presentation</H3>
In the visual world, the HTML + CSS combination convincingly separates
structured contents (the HTML document) from the presentation details (the
CSS specification). When we tried to adapt HTML to a voice setting, we
found out early that there is no such strong separation between contents
and presentation. Even with a library of pre-defined dialogues structures,
a programmer must skillfully add more contents, much of which concerns
presentation. For example: What is the initial prompt? What is the prompt
the <I>n</I>th time that the browser has not been able to interpret the
user's input? What is the speech recognition grammar? Is the grammar merged
with grammars for outer elements that have navigational options? What if
the user says "help"?

<P>The "help" problem illustrates a point fundamental to voice rendering:
that additional contents regarding the presentation itself must be added
in many places. We say that contents alone, such as represented in an HTML
document, must be <I>augmented </I>with additional <I>representational
contents</I>. Representational contents cannot be calculated from an HTML
document; such contents, as all other, require human insight.
<H3>
User input is often ambiguous</H3>
In the visual world, user input is usually treated as certain.&nbsp; For
example, there is no need to reconfirm the spelling of a city name. In
the voice world, we assume that a full keyboard is not available (for if
it were, a display would be nearby in most cases, and it would surely be
the output medium of choice for most people). So typically, input is either
by speech recognition or by keypads, such as the 12 keys on a usual phone
keypad. Speech input is ambiguous, and so is telephone keypad input, at
least when it comes to spelling (where one key denotes several letters).
In any case, the interactions or dialogues necessarily become complicated
if they are to deal well with the human factors involved.
<H2>
Requirements for a markup language for interactive voice rendering</H2>
Our experience with markup languages for HTTP-mediated IVR is that they
are very well-suited for the expression of contents, control flow, dialogues,
and the handling of exceptional situations. We believe that these concepts,
as a whole, are difficult to reconcile with HTML. This point of view, of
course, does not conflict with extending HTML with markup to improve voice
rendering, such as pronunciation clues or audio icons.&nbsp; In this section,
we present requirements for a voice markup language. The requirements are
intended to guide the development of a standard markup language, tentatively
called VXML (Voice eXtensible Markup Language).
<H3>
Abstraction</H3>
IVR services are typically written in general purpose languages that allow
for the precise temporal control of all resources at a cost of high program
complexity.&nbsp; Such resources include timers, speech recognizers, speech
synthesizers, and tone detectors. In contrast, VXML should provide abstractions
of platform capabilities that enable the author to focus on behavioral
aspects of the service, freeing them from platform-specific APIs.&nbsp;
VXML elements should encapsulate common IVR resource usage idioms, such
as playing a phrase or collecting input. It is an explicit goal to keep
the abstraction level high; in particular, most VXML documents should avoid
the use of C++, Java, or EcmaScript-like code to control a speech or telephony
API for reasons of safety, performance, and portability.

<P>We expect that VXML would have a pre-defined set of higher-level abstractions.&nbsp;
An author may use the higher-level abstraction capability to specify interaction
behaviors to address human factors, compatibility, and performance issues.
<H3>
Control Flow</H3>
Conventionally, IVR services are planned and designed in terms of flow
diagrams. Typically, control flow in IVR systems is affected both by synchronous
completion of an interaction and by asynchronous events.&nbsp; Often, control
flow is determined by previous inputs. Therefore, conditional branching
and other basic control flow, must be provided by the language.&nbsp; It
must also be possible to specify the output and control flow behavior of
a variety of asynchronous or exceptional events.
<H3>
HTML Reuse</H3>
There are several concepts of HTML that apply in the voice world. For example,
the document structure itself defines an implicit sequential flow of control.
Also, the static scoping in HTML achieved through nesting of elements should
be adopted by VXML. Many elements make sense as well: the LINK element
in the header section provides information about how the document is related
to others, and the information can be used for navigational purposes; the
SELECT element may be interpreted as an IVR menu; the FORM element defines
the name/value pairs that are to be returned to the server. By reusing
HTML as much as possible, we make VXML easier to learn and easier to use.
<H3>
Speech Standards Reuse</H3>
Converting text to audio output is a challenging problem.&nbsp; Most text-to-speech
engines attempt to infer prosody and pronunciation from the text, but mistakes
are common. In principle, we agree that specific speech markup is the correct
solution to minimizing the ambiguity inherent in text.&nbsp; In particular,
we recognize the efforts of the <A HREF="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/stml.html">Sable
Consortium</A> in codifying the capabilities of current text-to-speech
technology.&nbsp; Similar work is underway for other specialized markup
such as Automatic Speech Recognition grammars.&nbsp; Such formalisms are
outside the scope of the VXML definition, but a method for their incorporation
should be identified.
<H2>
Conclusion</H2>
Given the huge volume of information published through HTML, and the range
of services that are evolving on the Web, it is attractive to offer a voice
interpretation of HTML content. We believe that work can and will progress
in this area, but that there will be a desire on the part of many content
providers to target the voice medium precisely and directly, to create
high-quality voice services. Since it seems to us that HTML, even with
extensive style embellishment, is incapable of specifying the details of
the necessary voice interactions, our preference would be to standardize
on a fully explicit voice interaction language. This language could in
turn be targeted by applications that form a continuum from voice browsing
of existing HTML to hosting of IVR services. We think this approach would
serve the purposes of the voice browsing community by bringing about a
robust substrate relatively quickly. Once the mechanisms for voice browsing
of HTML content emerge, VXML voice browsers could incorporate the HTML
rules and style sheets. Even so, our experience suggests that it is likely
that different pages will be developed for voice and graphical rendering.
