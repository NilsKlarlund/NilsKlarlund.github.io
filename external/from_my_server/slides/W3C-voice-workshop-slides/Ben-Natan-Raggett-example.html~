<h2> from W3C "Voice browsers" note </h2> Dave Raggett and Or
Ben-Natan propose markup for navigational choice:
<blockquote>
<pre>
    &lt;P onselecttimeout='document.speak("You have
        not entered any selection, please enter your
        selection now")'&gt;
        &lt;A href=Instructions.html&gt;Directions&lt;/A&gt; 
        &lt;A href=Todo&gt;List of things to do&lt;/A&gt;
    &lt;/P&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

This piece of markup looks like contents, since that is what a
paragraph tag usually indicates.  But, in this case, judging from the
text of the <tt>onselecttimeout</tt>, the hyperlinks are not to be
construed as optional links that the user can choose to follow at any
point while accessing the page.  Instead, this HTML snippet is
intended as a kind of dialog, where the user is prompted for further
input.  It seems quite contrary to the philosophy of markup languages
that such functional use should not be expressed explicitly by named
semantic markers.  That is, we would expect an element, like

<blockquote> 
<pre> 
&lt;MENU&gt; 
  &lt;OPTION URL=Instructions.html&gt;Directions 
  &lt;OPTION URL=Todo&gt;List of things to do 
&lt;/MENU&gt;
</pre> 
</blockquote> 

where the <tt>&lt;MENU&gt;</tt> element here
explicitly marks the concept of a menu (the tag name
is not important  by  itself; for example, we
could   have  used the
<tt>&lt;SELECT&gt;</tt> tag, although it is not a usual select
element in the HTML sense, since there is no value assigned to a
name).
