HTML and VB: what's the deal?
</h1>
<hr class=top>

 
<h2> We believe that </h2>

Effective IVR service creation is possible
by Web authoring
<br>
<br>

A markup language is ideal for
<ul>
<li> hiding difficult APIs
<li> abstract away difficult concurrent programming
<li> codify proven principles  of IVR design 
</ul>

<h2> We're are not convinced that </h2>

Extensions to HTML  would  satisfy
requirements for effective IVR  creation
<br>
<br>
A designer's  intent with regard to voice interaction is well-supported
by HTML extensions
