    <sub>Abstract</sub> 

    <div  style="font-weight: bold;">
      IVR applications are notoriously difficult to construct.  To
      simplify the task, many layers of abstractions are introduced.  At
      the highest level, an application programmer is then mainly
      concerned about choosing pre-canned dialogues, which are filled in
      with a variety of parameters, such as prompts and timeout
      durations.  In this article, we will study how XML and the DSD
      Schema notation may alleviate the burden of understanding a
      specialized notation with many interdependent parameters and
      defaults.
    </div>
          
 <sub>Introduction</sub> 
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the XML hype, there is at least one fascinating
      and fundamental quantity that sets XML-based notations apart
      from ad hoc syntax: they encourage tree transformations---a
      technique that application programmers usually do not take
      advantage of.  It is a hassle even to define a set of parse trees
      and a procedure by which they are constructed!  XML completely
      circumvents this problem just by directly and simply being a
      notation for trees.  Of course, mappings of trees into trees are
      a main ingredient of computer science; for example, such
      mappings are essential to building compilers, where the
      compilation process is partioned into several phases, most of
      which simply massage one intermediate tree format into another
      one.
    </p>
    <p>The exciting development is that tree technology has already
      crept into everyday Web programming: CSS (Cascading Style
      Sheets) is a declarative notation for tree transformations that
      turn HTML into a visual formatting (page layout) model.  For
      example, it's easy to specify a rule that makes H1 headers be
      typeset in a font that is 120% of the size of the base font.
      CSS also allows HTML elements to be categorized according to
      <em>classes</em>, which are programmer-defined labels such as in

      <p>
	<myxml>
	  <ul class="myclass">
	    <li>This is my point.</li>
	  </ul>
	</myxml>
      </p>  
      Moreover, such classifications can be used to specify the
      formatting properties as in a CSS rule that forces all text in
      places like where "This is my point" is to be shown in red.
      More precisely, the rule specifies that text must be shown in
      red if it is contained in a <tt>li</tt> element that in turn is
      contained in an <tt>ul</tt> element with class attribute
      "myclass".</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, CSS cannot accomplish tree transformations
      into any other domains than the non-XML formatting model.  The
      W3C instead envisages that XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language
      Transformations) together with the built-in default insertion
      mechanism of DTDs and XML schemas will cover transformational
      needs in general.  However, XSLT likely is too complicated and
      too programmatic (in the sense of being a Turing-compete
      programming language) to be adopted by the majority of
      programmers---and even if it were to be well-known, there are
      many situations where its explicit programming model competes
      unfavorable with CSS.  For example, it is becoming a common
      paradigm to use XSLT and CSS in conjunction for visual
      formatting applications, since they complement each other
      nicely.
    </p>

    <p>In this article, we will study the benefits of XML for the
    problem of building IVR applications, especially with respect to
    default insertions.  In particular, we will argue that DSDs
    (Document Structure Descriptions), see <a
    href="http://www.brics.dk/DSD/">http://www.brics.dk/DSD/</a>,
    offer special advantages for this problem when compared to other
    schema notations, like DTDs or XML Schema.</p>

    <sub>The IVR scenario</sub>
    <p>
      Our scenario calls for an application programmer to develop a
      little whimsical, interactive voice application that probes the
      mood of a customer.  The programmer will use an XML notation
      called XPML (for Extensible Phone Markup Language), which is
      similar to HTML.  The XPML notation is based on PML, the Phone
      Markup Language, as developed at AT&amp;T Labs-Research.  The
      main idea of PML is that simple HTML pages describe a
      finite-state machine, where intra-page hyperlinks become goto
      statements and text becomes synthesized speech; input fields
      corresponds to subdialogues for obtaining numbers and select
      elements become dialogues a la "for sales, choose 1; for
      customer service, choose 2,...".  Naturally, each subdialogue
      construct provides numerals parameters for specifying prompts,
      timeout durations, and help messages in various error
      situations.  As a further complication, that are several
      interdependencies among these parameters.  For example, it was
      discovered during the development of PML that it is not
      sufficient to associate one dialogue style to each HTML element;
      rather, a set of interaction styles must be provided to through
      an <tt>interaction</tt> attribute to accommodate situations
      where there are many choices in a menu, the input of certain
      kinds of numbers, etc. Naturally, the kinds of prompts, along
      with many other parameters, are dependent on the value of this
      attribute.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      The XPML notation as outlined here is preliminary
      and incomplete. It is similar to VoiceXML (a new dialogue
      markup language developed by AT&amp;T, IBM, Lucent and
      Motorola); rather, we are interested in explaining some general
      issues surrounding the use of XML for interactive voice
      applications.  
    </p>     

    <sub>DSDs -- a schema notation for XML</sub> 
    <p>
      DSDs are grammars for describing classes of XML documents, see
      <a href="http://www.brics.dk/DSD/">http://www.brics.dk/DSD/</a>.
      Thus, a DSD renders a judgment on every XML document: either it
      is <em>valid</em> or it is invalid.  In this way, a DSD defines
      a class of XML documents, just like the more familar DTD concept
      of the XML 1.0 specification.  A DSD processor takes as input an
      application document and a DSD; if it determines that the
      application document is that it according to the DSD, then it
      outputs the application document augmented with inserted
      defaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      An effort is underway at the W3C to define XML Schema, a
      successor for DTDs, which are not very expressive.  Judging from
      the size of the current specification, one may say that XML
      Schema is an order of magnitude more complicated than DTDs or
      DSDs.  There are, however, many desirable properties that XML
      Schema cannot describe such as disallowed attribute
      combinations, or element content that depend on attributes.
      More importantly for the focus of this article, DSDs define
      generic, CSS-like default mechanisms that allow an application
      programmer to specify defaults in a declarative way.  The DSD
      processor ensures that only meaningful defaults are inserted,
      according to the DSD.  This technique is a logical and practical
      extension of the default mechanisms that are already part of
      DTDs and XML Schema.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this document, we will explain how XML and DSDs help both the
      application programmer and the platform programmer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>DSDs aid the XPML programmer to choose the right syntactic
	constructs.  DSDs are by themselves not easy too read
	because of the XML syntax, so we indicate how to present
	them in a more conventional BNF-like way that closely
	resembles the concrete syntax of the XPML notation.</li>
      <li>
	XPML programmers can easily check their documents for most
	errors using the DSD processor alone.
      </li>
      <li>
	XPML programmers can use the CSS-like default mechanism
	that comes with DSDs.  Thus, XPML programs can be "styled"
	in a declarative and modular fashion.
      </li>
      <li>
	DSD descriptions significantly simplify the programming
	of an interpreter for XPML.</li>
    </ul>
      
      <sub>DSDs for syntax explanations</sub>
    <p>
      Let's suppose an application programmer is working on a program
      for demonstrating voice interaction.  He wants to use XPML, but
      he doesn't know what XPML is except for some examples he has
      seen.  Naturally, he'll use these examples for guidance, but the
      DSD may provide a readable, concise syntactic summary.  We don't
      envisage that the programmer will read the DSD as an XML file.
      Instead, a hyperlinked HTML document may be produced by an XSLT
      stylesheet transformation.  For example, the DSD definition of
      the element <tt>XPML</tt>, the top element of an XPML document,
      is shown below (left) through an XSLT stylesheet transformation
      in a way that strongly suggests the concrete syntax of an
      application document; the original DSD definition (right) will
      not be shown to the application programmer:

      <tt>body</tt> element.  The <tt>head</tt> is defaultable (which
      means that it may be omitted if a default for it has been

      constraint named <tt>head-constraint</tt>.  Similarly, the
      <tt>body</tt> element is specified by the constraint
      <tt>body-constraint</tt>.  We will not go into any details about
      DSDs here---we hope that the informal explanations are
      sufficient.  The XSLT stylesheet can be found at the DSD Web
      site; it is rather complicated, approximately 25 pages.

    <sub>DSDs for debugging</sub>
    <p>
      Now, we will explore how schemas may help debug XML documents.
      Let's assume that the application programmer's first attempt at
      the mood-probing XPML program is:
    </p>
    <example>
      <myxml>
	<?dsd URI="xpml-att.dsd"?>
	
	<XPML>
	  <head>
	    
	    <application name="HELLOWORLD"/>
	    
	    <maintainer address="karam@research.att.com" loglevel="2"/>
	    
	    <title myxml:il="yes">The Greeting Application</title>
	    
	  </head>
	  
	  <body>
	    
    Welcome to greetings are us.
    <span nointerrupt="y" myxml:il="yes"> <audio url="/audioclips/greeting.vox"/></span>

    <a name="repeat"/> 

    <menu name="feelings">
      <option dtmf="0" myxml:il="yes">To end</option>
      <do myxml:il="yes"><a href="#endit"/><comment>go to end point</comment></do>

      <option myxml:il="yes"> If you are feeling like a cowboy. </option>
      <do myxml:il="yes"> Howdy world! </do> 

      <option myxml:il="yes"> If you are feeling like a Canadian. </option>
      <do myxml:il="yes"> Gid'day world, how's it going eh? </do> 

    </menu>
  	  
    <a href="#repeat"/> 
	  
    <a name="endit"/> 
    
  </body>

</XPML>
    </myxml>
</example>
<p>
The programmer has inserted a <tt>&lt;?dsd URI="xpml-att.dsd"?&gt;</tt>
processing instruction to denote that the document must conform to the
DSD named <tt>xpml-att.dsd</tt>.  He can now use the DSD processor to
check the syntax of the document.  It'll tell him:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
Error in 'greetings-first-attempt.pml' 
line 10: attribute 'nointerrupt' has illegal value 'y'
while checking attribute in constraint 
"message-attributes", 'xpml-core.dsd' line 377
</pre>
    </p>
<p>
The DSD  describes this constraint as follows:
</p>
<example class="dsdpretty">
<div style="margin-bottom:2ex; margin-top:1ex;">
<div style="font-family: Courier; font-weight:bold;   margin-left: 2.7ex;                 text-indent: -2.7ex; ">
<span class="key">ConstraintDef </span><span class="special-key">ID=</span><a Name="N-1379542679" class="user-bold">message-attributes</a><span>: </span><span><span></span><div style="font-family: Courier; font-weight:bold;   margin-left: 2.7ex;  text-indent: -2.7ex; ">
	      <span class="concrete">nointerrupt=</span><span class="concrete">"</span><span><span></span><a class="user" href="#N-1379542679">YesOrNo</a><span class="concrete">"</span><span> </span><span class="key">[<span class="special-key">Optional</span>]</span></span></div></span></div></div>
   </example>
Thus, the constraint declares the attribute
    <tt>nointerrupt</tt> whose string type is <tt>YesOrNo</tt>.
In turn, the DSD details that
<example class="dsdpretty">
      <div style="margin-bottom:2ex; margin-top:1ex; ">
	<div style=" font-family: Courier; font-weight:bold;   margin-left: 2.7ex;                 text-indent: -2.7ex; ">
<span class="key">StringTypeDef </span><span
class="special-key">ID=</span><a Name="N-1388455575"
class="user-bold">YesOrNo</a><span>: </span><span><span></span><div
style=" font-family: Courier; font-weight:bold; margin-left: 2.7ex;
text-indent: -2.7ex; "> <span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span
class="tt">yes</span><span>"</span> | </span><span><span>"</span><span
class="tt">Yes</span><span>"</span> | </span><span><span>"</span><span
class="tt">no</span><span>"</span> | </span><span><span>"</span><span
class="tt">No</span><span>"</span>)</span></div></span></div></div></example>
So, the programmer must write <tt>"yes" </tt>, not <tt>"y"</tt>.  This
example illustrates our belief that DSDs  provide concise and
useful error messages that do not necessitate a complete understanding
of the DSD itself.

<sub>DSDs for myriads of defaults</sub> 

Once the above error is corrected, the DSD processor will accept the
document and it'll insert all the default attributes and default
elements specified by the XPML DSD.  The resulting document 
is
<example>
<myxml>
<?dsd URI="xpml-att.dsd"?>
<XPML>
  <head>


    <application name="HELLOWORLD"/>
    
    <maintainer address="karam@research.att.com" loglevel="2"/>

    <title>The Greeting Application</title>

    <a name="repeat"/> 

    <menu asrmode="none" endchars="#" finaltimeout="5000ms" 
          interaction="basic" interdigittimeout="4000ms" 
          maxmisselected="3" maxtimeout="2" maxtterrs="3" 
          name="feelings" timeout="0ms">

      <counttimeout myxml:il="yes">Sorry, too many timeouts.</counttimeout>
      <pause myxml:il="yes"> Pausing.  Press pound sign to continue.
      </pause>
   
    </menu>
  	  
    <a href="#repeat"/> 
	  
    <a name="endit"/> 
    
  </body>

</XPML>
	</myxml>
      </example>
      <p>
	
	It is similar to the original document except that a variety
	of timing and counting parameters, like
	<tt>interdigittimeout="4000ms"</tt> have been inserted.  Also,
	various default messages used in error and help situations,
	like <myxml><help>No help is available.</help></myxml> have
	been inserted.  Voice programming is dependent on a great
	number of parameters whose tuning is often essential to
	obtaining the right performance.  But they are not usually
	something that the programmer wants to explain in exquisite
	detail for every part of the PML document.
      </p>

<subsub>DSD defaults for customization</subsub>

The XPML programmer may easily override defaults of his choosing.  For
example, he may change the <tt>interdigittimeout</tt> value whenever
it's inserted by putting a DSD default declaration into the
application document like:

      <example>
	<myxml>
	  <DSD:Default>
	    <DefaultAttribute Name="interdigittimeout" Value="1000ms"/>
	  </DSD:Default>
	</myxml>
      </example>

Such a declaration can occur anywhere in the application document; its
scope consists of all its siblings and their descendants.  So in this
case, the programmer may insert the DSD default declaration as a child
of the <tt>body</tt> element; the effect is that the
<tt>interdigittimeout</tt> attribute for the <tt>menu</tt> event will
be inserted with value <tt>1000ms</tt>.

<subsub>DSD stylesheets</subsub> 

The DSD defaults may be gathered in XML external parsed entities,
which are just like XML documents except that multiple root elements
are allowed.  Below, we define a DSD stylesheet that overrides the
default <tt>help</tt> element for the <tt>menu</tt> construct in two
ways: for a <tt>menu</tt> without a <tt>class</tt> attribute, the
message "We're sorry, can't help you more right now, but please call
us at 1-800-greetings" is specified; for a <tt>menu</tt> with a
<tt>class</tt> attribute of value <tt>moody</tt>, the default content
of <tt>help</tt> becomes "How are you feeling, dud? press 1 to get
relief",

<example>
<myxml>
    <DSD:Default>
      <Context>
	<Element Name="menu"/>
      </Context>
	<DefaultContent>
	<help>We're sorry, can't help you more right now, but please
	  call us at 1-800-greetings</help>
      </DefaultContent>
    </DSD:Default>

<DSD:Default>
  <Context>
    <Element Name="menu">
      <Attribute Name="class" Value="moody"/>
    </Element>
  </Context>
  <DefaultContent>
    <help>How are you feeling, dud? press 1 to get relief</help>
  </DefaultContent>
</DSD:Default>

	</myxml>
</example>
      

<sub>DSDs for evolving languages</sub>

    In practice, it's rather impractical to describe a DSD as a single
    document.  It's better to describe the main structure in a base
    document, while extensions---which can be platform specific
    additions or convenient abstractions--can be documented in
    follow-up documents.

    <subsubsub>The core of XPML</subsubsub> XPML in essence is
    described in <a href="xpml-core.html">xpml-core.dsd</a>.
    (For a more detailed explanation of this DSD, see below.)  This
    language introduces an HTML-like structure and touchtone-based
    input modalities, including a number of specialized parameters.
    Also, defaults are provided for all parameters that a beginning
    XPML programmer should not need to worry about.

    <subsubsub>Adding speech markup to XPML</subsubsub>



Separately, in <a href="xpml-speech.html">speech recognition
extensions</a>, it is described how the high-level construct
<tt>menu</tt> may be further refined by speech recognition parameters.
Specifically, the constraint that describes <tt>menu</tt> attributes
and content is extended with a declaration of an attribute
<tt>asrmode</tt> that has the value '<tt>none</tt>', '<tt>only</tt>', or
'<tt>plus</tt>':

    <subsubsub>Combining it all</subsubsub>
DSDs may include other DSDs, so XPML is put together from 
the three parts just described in
<a href="xpml.html">xpml.dsd</a>. 

 <subsubsub>Extending XPML with AT&amp;T specific
additions</subsubsub> It's now possible to round off the description
of XPML with properties, like metrics, that are specific to the
AT&amp;T platform.  That's done by further extending the XPML DSD, see
<a href="xpml-att.html">xpml-att.dsd</a>.

<sub>DSDs for simplifying semantic processing</sub>

    With a DSD processor, an XML document can be <em>normalized</em>
by default insertion: since defaults cannot be removed by defaults in
an application document, only overridden, the defaults given with the
DSD itself provide a set of assumptions about the shape of the
document that results from running the DSD processor on a valid
document.  For example, the XPML interpreter can assume <tt>menu</tt>
elements that are fully filled in with timing attributes and content
such as <tt>help</tt> and <tt>error</tt> messages.

<sub>How to read the XPML DSD</sub>

A DSD is itself an XML document, and as such barely readable.  So the
DSD is presented through a transformation that yields an HTML document
that can be displayed by any browser.  The displayed notation that
we've chosen here is one that emphasizes the concrete syntax of the
XML documents specified by the DSD. 
The essential structure of XPML is described
in the DSD <a href="xpml-core.html">xpml-core.dsd (html)</a> (compare
to <a href="xpml-core.txt">xpml-core.xml (raw XML)</a>).  The
first box framed in pink is an element definition that describes the
<tt>XPML</tt> element itself.  This element must be the root of any
XML document conforming to the xpml-core DSD as specified in the
second line of the header. The <tt>XPML</tt> element definition is
named by a nonterminal ID, which happens also to be <tt>XPML</tt>.
(When there are different uses of an element with the same name, the
nonterminals allow us to distinguish their descriptions.) According to
the element definition, the <tt>XPML</tt> element consists of two
things in sequence:
<ul> 
<li>
A <tt>head</tt> element, whose attributes and 
	content are specified as the constraint <em>head-constraint</em>; and
</li>
<li>
	a <tt>body</tt> element, which has attributes and content
specified as the constraint
<em>body-constraint</em>
</li>
</ul>
    The    <em>head-constraint</em> specifies
    <ul>
      <li>
	a <tt>title</tt> element (the question mark after it means that it is
optional),
      </li>
      <li>
	<tt>meta</tt> elements (zero or more as indicated by the star),
	each having a required <tt>name</tt> and <tt>content</tt> attribute, and
      </li>
      <li><em>pragma</em> elements.</li>
    </ul>
<p>The order of these
various elements is not important.</p>

<p>A note about syntax for content: parentheses containing a
comma-separated list of content descriptions mean the same thing as in
DTDs, namely all content that is a sequence of what's inside the
parentheses; similarly, a |-separated list denotes a union.</p>

<p>The content known as <em>pragma</em> is defined in the third box.
This content definition and element that is one of three different
kinds.
</p> 

<p>In a DSD description, content and attribute declarations may be
lumped together in constraints.  This abstraction technique is
illustrated in the constraint definition of <a
href="xpml-core.html#N-1215144099">menu-constraint</a>.  This is the
constraint that is redefined twice to accommodate speech
parameters and additional markup related to interaction types.
</p>

<p>The remainder of this DSD description of the core of XPML should be
rather self-explanatory.  We use string types to characterize the
allowed attribute values (unless a "?"  indicates that there are no
restrictions).  When the introduction of additional attributes or
content depend on the context, we use if statements that are
conditioned on context expressions similar to those of CSS.
</p>

<subsub>The components of the DSD for XPML</subsub>
<ul>
<li>The core: <a href="xpml-core.html">xpml-core.dsd (html)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-core.txt">xpml-core.dsd (xml as .txt)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-core.xml">xpml-core.dsd (xml)</a>;</li>
<li>The speech extensions: 
<a href="xpml-speech.html">xpml-speech.dsd (html)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-speech.txt">xpml-speech.dsd (xml as .txt)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-speech.xml">xpml-speech.dsd (xml)</a>;</li>
<li>The menu interaction extensions: 
<a href="xpml-menu-interaction.html">xpml-menu-interaction.dsd (html)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-menu-interaction.txt">xpml-menu-interaction.dsd (xml as .txt)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-menu-interaction.xml">xpml-menu-interaction.dsd (xml)</a>;</li>
<li>The AT&amp;T extensions: 
<a href="xpml-att.html">xpml-att.dsd (html)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-att.txt">xpml-att.dsd (xml as .txt)</a>,
 <a href="xpml-att.xml">xpml-att.dsd (xml)</a>;</li>
</ul>

<subsub>Another HTML-like example</subsub> Here are links to an XPML
example that contains form and input elements; note that lots of
errors in such a form will not be caught by most other schema
notations: <tt>form</tt> elements inside <tt>form</tt> elements,
<tt>input</tt> elements not inside <tt>form</tt> elements,
<tt>input</tt> elements of type <tt>submit</tt> with other attributes
than <tt>name</tt> and <tt>value</tt>, <tt>input</tt> of type
<tt>submit</tt> with a <tt>value</tt> attribute but without a
<tt>name</tt> attribute, and so on.
<ul>
<li>The form example: 
 <a href="blue-widgets.txt">blue-widgets.pml (xml as .txt)</a>,
 <a href="blue-widgets.xml">blue-widgets.pml (xml)</a>;</li>
</ul>

    <sub>Conclusion</sub>

    We have shown through our IVR examples that schemas play an
    important role for the practical handling of domain specific
    languages expressed in XML.  In particular, we have demonstrated
    that the CSS-like default mechanism provided by DSDs may be an
    easily graspable alternative to XSLT transformations.
