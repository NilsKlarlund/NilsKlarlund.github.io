      <h2>Cumulative Trauma Disorder</h2>
      <em>Cumulative Trauma
	Disorder</em> (<em>CTD</em>) and <em>Repetitive Stress
	Injury</em> (<em>RSI</em>) cover an array of poorly understood
	soft tissue problems.  For more information, excellent
	up-to-date Web sites to visit are <a href='http://www.mousewatch.com'>www.mousewatch.com</a> and <a href='http://www.engr.unl.edu/ee/eeshop/rsi.html'>Computer
	Related Repetitive Strain Injury</a> by Paul Marxhausen.  The
	organization <a href='http://www.ctdrn.org/'>CTD Resource
	Network, Inc.</a> also provides information and assistance in
	this area; it maintains the <a href='http://www.tifaq.org'>Typing
	Injury FAQ</a> site.

      <h3>Personal story</h3>
      </a> I am
	recovering from a such a problem, a typing injury sustained in
	December of 1991 (tendinitis in forearms).  In the beginning,
	I went through multiple cortisone injections, heat and cold
	treatments, massage, physiotherapy, arm braces, casts, and
	long periods with minimum typing.  For several years, I let my
	wife drive; I pushed typing work onto my co-authors or
	secretaries; and I experimented relentlessly with alternative
	treatments and input devices.  The first four years, nothing
	helped—except not typing.  Then, DragonDictate, an early
	speech recognition program, together with foot switches,
	slowly allowed me to push more work away from my arms.
	<p>
	  I have tried most kinds of "ergonomic" aids available:
	  dozens of pointing devices, several keyboards, and various
	  instruments for stabilizing upper extremities.  I have
	  concluded that most are ineffective and that some are
	  harmful.  Initial positive impressions turned out to be
	  wrong.  There is some commercially available equipment that
	  I prefer, see <a href='input_devices/index_setup.html'>my
	  setup</a>.
	</p>
      <p>
	  Additionally, I have vigorously pursued ideas of my own.  I
	  have constructed three kinds of keyboards, several foot
	  switch arrangements, and a dozen mouse designs.  They have
	  generally failed my own trials. The exceptions are the ideas
	  I put forward in <a href='input_devices/index.html'>Input devices,
	  a usage-driven approach</a>.  
	</p>
      <p>Speech recognition place a very important role in my daily
	work.  I have found dictation system user interfaces rather
	unusable because of their slowness and incompleteness.  For
	six years, I have researched alternatives.  Out of these
	frustrating efforts has emerged an editing language I call <a href='ShortTalk/index.html'>ShortTalk</a>.  Measurements
	indicate that ShortTalk on the average may be much faster than
	conventional means of editing.
	</p>
      <p>Lately, I can easily type for an hour or so, and finally my
	  arms are well enough that I can travel with a normal load of
	  luggage.  But half a day at the keyboard still produces
	  flare-ups lasting a couple of days.  With my workspace setup
	  explained in <a href='index_uisummary.html'>User interface
	  summary</a>, I can work all day with no adverse affects.
