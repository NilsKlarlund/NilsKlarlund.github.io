    <h1>ReX—towards a foundation for multimodal,
    multimedia applications</h1>
    <p>It is a fascinating fact that automated, interactive
	telephone systems, often called IVR-systems (IVR=Interactive
	Voice Response), remain frustratingly difficult to use.  In
	large part, the reason is that their programming is so
	difficult.  So here is an area where programming language
	research must be of importance?  Unfortunately, no convincing
	solution ever emerged, and now something an order of magnitude
	more complicated is becoming commonplace: interactive,
	multimedia content!
	</p>
    <p>Fortunately, interesting proposals have been formulated.
	For example, the W3C has proposed SMIL, a declarative notation
	for synchronizing media streams.  But on the input side, which
	may include handwriting recognition and speech recognition on
	small devices, progress has been limited.  Notations like
	VoiceXML lack a solid programming language foundation, and
	also do not take into account the fickleness of speech input.
	In particular, programmers must manually construct support for
	error correction.
	</p>
    <p>We have tried to address these issues in our work on ReX, a
	reactive language for interactive, multimedia presentations.
	You can see our ideas in <a href="papers/Rex-Eurospeech01.pdf">our paper</a>.
