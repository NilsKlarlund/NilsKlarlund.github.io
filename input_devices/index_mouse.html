	    The mouse is a spoiler.  Whenever you put your hand on it,
	    you stress your body.  If for a moment you forget to apply a
	    lifting force to your fingers, then buttons are immediately
	    activated.  Consequently, your body must work constantly with
	    shoulder, limb, hand, and finger positions to not press
	    buttons.  Unless, of course, you take your hand away from
	    the device.  Something the size and shape of it discourage
	    you from doing.  The lighter the mouse buttons are to
	    depress, and the bigger they are, the more static force is
	    needed to prevent accidental mouse clicks.  Thus, curiously,
	    there may be a direct relationship between how "ergonomic"
	    the mouse is and how harmful it is.
	  </p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	    The keyboard is much more forgiving in this regard.  It is
	    natural to rest the hands in front of the keyboard as soon
	    as they are not in use.  But given that the mouse inherently
	    forces an unnatural, constant muscle response, I believe
	    that researching mouse curvatures alone is an exercise in
	    futility.
	  </p>
                
          <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The buttonless mouse</h3>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	    Instead, mouse buttons must be entirely removed from the
	    pointing device itself.  This is not a radical idea: on
	    laptops, the pointing device (stick or pad) is separated
	    from the buttons.  Also, the new mouse feature called a
	    scroll-wheel should be moved to the keyboard.  The mouse is
	    the last place another function should be placed.  Finally,
	    the proper mouse size is less than the standard one.
	  </p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now what are the consequences?  The series of pictures
	    below illustrate five of numerous ways a small, buttonless
	    mouse can be manipulated.  (The mouse shown has actually its
	    buttons disabled.)  Most of these poses are not possible with
	    a conventional mouse unless various fingers are
	    counter-balanced to not depress the buttons.

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These pictures indicate how an appropriate shape allows the
	    the mouse to be manipulated by just putting a part of the hand
	    on top of it, while the side of the hand still rests on the
	    table.  This easy-on-off principle encourages the hand to rest
	    on the desk, not on top of the mouse.  It is still possible to
	    have the hand ride on top of the mouseâ€”while the hand gets
	    gets a lot of support both from the desk, because the mouse
	    fits in the palm of the hand, and from the mouse itself,
	    because of the lack of buttons.  Note that to use the mouse in
	    such varied ways, where hands are given plenty of resting
	    areas, more space is needed than what is usually available on
	    a keyboard tray.  That's why I believe that reducing keyboard
	    size, or getting rid of it by combining speech recognition and
	    foot pedals, is very important.</p>
                
          <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">And where do the buttons
	    go?</h3>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	    The buttons may go on either side of the keyboard or be foot
	    activated.  In <a href="index_keyboard.html">keyboard</a>, I propose
	    how scrolling functionality and mouse buttons can be
	    conveniently combined on a keyboard.  This arrangement will
	    not slow you down: as one hand is leaving the keyboard to
	    locate the mouse, the other slides to the side where the
	    buttons are easily found.  And, in <a href="index_footpedals.html">foot pedals</a> I
	    consider available and future foot switches.
	  </p>
                
          <h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trials</h3>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	    I believe that it would be interest to carry out controlled
	    trials of simplified, buttonless mouse designs.  If the
	    design of the mouse impacts its injury potential, then a
	    study is more likely to demonstrate this effect the larger
	    it is.  The removal of buttons may offer the best chance for
	    obtaining such an effect.
