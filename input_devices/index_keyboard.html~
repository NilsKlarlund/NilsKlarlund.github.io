      <p>From bitter experience, I don't believe that the keyboard
	  can be improved much.  Three times, and without success, I
	  have built whole keyboards from scratch.  Nevertheless,
	  there are a few changes I would like to see done to the
	  keyboard:
	  <ul>
              <li>A smaller footprint allowing more rest areas for hands
	    and a mousing area closer to the center of the body.</li>
          <li>Widely spaced modifier keys so they can be pressed by
	    the side of your hand instead of requiring pinky
	    contortions.</li>
          <li>Mouse buttons on the side so as to allow a buttonless
	    <a href='index_mouse.html'>mouse</a>.
	    </li>
          <li>A scroll tread or belt on the side of keyboard to make
	    browsing possible without dependence on finger-skills.  A
	    large scroll wheel might also be sufficient instead of the
	    more complicated thread mechanism.</li>
          <li>A numeric keypad that does not make the keyboard as
	    wide as normal 101-key models.</li>
          <li>A flat design, akin to that of a laptop keyboard, but
	      with 3mm key travel and good mechanical feed-back.
	    </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Why keyboards have gotten less ergonomic</h3>
      <p>
	  For modifier keys, such as <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>Shft</tt>,
	  ergonomicity has declined.  When they are widely spaced
	  apart <img width='100' align='right' src='../photos/spacing-left-modifier.jpg' alt='Widely spaced    Ctrl and Alt keys'/> as on keyboards made in the mid '90s,
	  these keys can be depressed easily with the side of the hand
	  or with the outer side of the curled-up little finger, all
	  while the thumb is facing upwards<img width='100' align='left' alt='Pressing modifier    keys without strained uses of fingers' src='../photos/good-modifier-use.jpg'/>.  In
	  this way, the strenuous finger work usually associated with
	  chording is avoided.  Unfortunately, modern keyboards suffer
	  from extraneous OS-specific keys that prevent this technique
	  from being used.  (Except if these keys are uprooted or
	  lowered.)  On a flat keyboard, such as on a notebook
	  computer, fingers are even further restrained by the
	  flatness from hitting keys in a variety of ways—something
	  that is likely an ergonomic drawback.
	</p>
      <h3>A keyboard layout proposal</h3>
      <p>A keyboard  
	layout following these ideas mentioned above is suggested in 
	<a href='#fig1'>Figure 1</a>.  Below it's shown (left) how a
	large, comfortable belt may be placed on the left side of the
	keyboard, along with mouse buttons; the side of the hand
	(right), not the fingers, securely moves the belt.
