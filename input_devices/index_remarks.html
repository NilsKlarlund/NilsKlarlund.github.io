      <p>Although some "ergonomic" accessories or devices may fit
	certain people, I believe that there are easily argued reasons
	why most of them will not work or even may be harmful.  These
	opinions are examples only, offered to stimulate critical
	thinking.</p>
      <h4>Forearm rests</h4> 

	These often elaborate mechanical contraptions support your
	forearm even while in motion over the keyboard.  But a
	fundamental misunderstanding may be a play here: the muscles
	of the forearm lift a heavy object, the hand, that is not
	supported by forearm rests.  So, the full weight of these
	long, bony structures still have to be born by the forearms.
	And, perversely, the forearm rests may make it cumbersome to
	place the arms in a position where the hand and forearm can
	truly rest, because it takes quite an effort to get in and out
	of these devices.  As a result, the strain on the forearms may
	be very significantly increased by using forearm rests.

	<h4>Contoured keyboards</h4> 

	In these keyboards, the majority of the keys are placed inside
	a depression along a curvature.  There is one depression for
	each hand, so that the keyboard may look like two bowls in a
	frame.  By matching the movement patterns on the fingers—the
	theory goes—these keyboard are easier on the body.  But
	precisely thanks to this property, the keyboard will force the
	hands into hovering in a specific position in space above it.
	In contrast, a flatter layout gives superior flexibility for
	striking the keys.
	
	<h4>Microswitch keyboards</h4>
      <p>This paradigm stipulates again
	  that motion is at the heart of injury.  The keyboards
	  accommodate each finger in an individual fixed area or well in
	  close proximity to tiny switches.  Then minuscule movements of
	  fingers active switches.  Phenomenal typing speeds are
	  achievable.  I got the feeling when using a design of my own
	  of getting a kind of direct feed from brain to computer.  But
	  again, there is a fundamental misunderstanding at play if the
	  aim is to reduce physical strain: the body must continuously
	  adjust the position of all fingers so that they don't touch
	  the switches.  This compensation includes maintaining
	  positions of hands, forearms, not to say the whole body.
	  Again, the conventional keyboard is superior.  With it, the
	  hands are free all the time, except for the moment of strike,
	  to rest or to hover over the keyboard.
	</p>
      <h4>Tablets</h4>
      <p>It has been suggested that using a pen on
	a tablet is more ergonomic than using a mouse.  Unfortunately,
	there is a condition called writer's cramp that has been known
	for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and it is likely to
	affect the tablet user as well.  Holding a pen puts static
	load on the whole upper body, so that the pen is not dropped
	and does not touch the tablet when not in use.
	</p>
      <h4>Touch pads</h4>
      <p>So what about not holding anything at
	all?  The touch pad offers such a solution, but as most people
	have experienced, this technology does not work to well
	either.  The cramped space is anything but natural for tracing
	the movement of the cursor by using the index finger.  Even if
	the touch pad was big enough that the whole hand could rest on
	it, it would still induce static stress: the hand must be
	turned so that the index finger does not touch the surface,
	whenever the cursor is not moved.
	</p>
      <h4>Trackballs</h4>
      <p>There are good things be said about
	trackballs: the hand may rest next to the device while the
	cursor is not being moved.  Moving the cursor can be done with
	the thumb or side of the hand, and the hand easy changes
	position between a resting state and an active state.
	Unfortunately, most trackballs that are on the market have
	large, easily depressed buttons surrounding the ball.  This
	"ergonomic" look probably have the opposite effect: the hand
	constantly must balance itself to not touch the buttons
	whenever near the device.  So, such trackballs may be as
	harmful as ordinary mice.
