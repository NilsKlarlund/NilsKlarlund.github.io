          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although some “ergonomic” accessories or devices may fit
	  certain people, I believe that there are easily argued reasons
	  why most of them may not work or may even be harmful.  These
	  opinions are examples only, offered to stimulate critical
	  thinking.</p>
                
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Forearm rests</h4> 

          	These often elaborate mechanical contraptions support your
          	forearm even while in motion over the keyboard.  But a
          	fundamental misunderstanding may be a play here: the muscles
          	of the forearm lift a heavy object, the hand, that is not
          	supported by forearm rests.  So, the full weight of these
          	long, bony structures still have to be born by the forearms.
          	And, perversely, the forearm rests may make it cumbersome to
          	place the arms in a position where the hand and forearm can
          	truly rest, because it takes quite an effort to get in and out
          	of these devices.  As a result, the strain on the forearms may
          	be very significantly increased by using forearm rests.

          	
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contoured keyboards</h4> 

          	In these keyboards, the majority of the keys are placed inside
          	a depression along a curvature.  There is one depression for
          	each hand, so that the keyboard may look like two bowls in a
          	frame.  By matching the movement patterns on the fingers&mdash;the
          	theory goes&mdash;these keyboard are easier on the body.  But
          	precisely thanks to this property, the keyboard will force the
          	hands into hovering in a specific position in space above it.
          	In contrast, a flatter layout gives superior flexibility for
          	striking the keys.
          	
          	
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Microswitch keyboards</h4>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This paradigm stipulates again
	  that motion is at the heart of injury.  The keyboards
	  accommodate each finger in an individual fixed area or well in
	  close proximity to tiny switches.  Then minuscule movements of
	  fingers active switches.  Phenomenal typing speeds are
	  achievable.  I got the feeling when using a design of my own
	  of getting a kind of direct feed from brain to computer.  But
	  again, there is a fundamental misunderstanding at play if the
	  aim is to reduce physical strain: the body must continuously
	  adjust the position of all fingers so that they don't touch
	  the switches.  This compensation includes maintaining
	  positions of hands, forearms, not to say the whole body.
	  Again, the conventional keyboard is superior.  With it, the
	  hands are free all the time, except for the moment of strike,
	  to rest or to hover over the keyboard.
	</p>
                
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tablets</h4>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been suggested that using a pen on
	  a tablet is more ergonomic than using a mouse.  Unfortunately,
	  there is a condition called writer's cramp that has been known
	  for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and it is likely to
	  affect the tablet user as well.  Holding a pen puts static
	  load on the whole upper body, so that the pen is not dropped
	  and does not touch the tablet when not in use.
	</p>
                
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Touch pads</h4>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So what about not holding anything at
	  all?  The touch pad offers such a solution, but as most people
	  have experienced, this technology does not work to well
	  either.  The cramped space is anything but natural for tracing
	  the movement of the cursor by using the index finger.  Even if
	  the touch pad was big enough that the whole hand could rest on
	  it, it would still induce static stress: the hand must be
	  turned so that the index finger does not touch the surface,
	  whenever the cursor is not moved.
	</p>
                
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trackballs</h4>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are good things be said about
	  trackballs: the hand may rest next to the device while the
	  cursor is not being moved.  Moving the cursor can be done with
	  the thumb or side of the hand.  Unfortunately, most trackballs
	  that are on the market have large, easily depressed buttons
	  surrounding the ball.  This "ergonomic" look probably have the
	  opposite effect: the hand constantly must balance itself to
	  not touch the buttons whenever near the device.  So, such
	  trackballs may be as harmful as ordinary mice.
	</p>
                
          <h4 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">So, what helps?</h4>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I believe that no tinkering with
	  keyboard or mouse design will lead to products that are
	  radically less stressful on the body.  Marginal improvements,
	  perhaps along the lines I've suggested, may be possible.
	  Ergonomic manuals consistently state that there is one way
	  only to effectively address severe cases of overuse syndromes:
	  complete and total cessation of the physical activity that led
	  to the problem.  Sometimes this cessation must be permanent,
	  often implying a loss of ability to work.  Finger and hand
	  work must be avoided in any form that resembles the
	  injury-causing way of working.</p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An approach to reduce physical impact might be: type
	  with only the strongest fingers (thumb and index) and move a
	  mouse by pushing it with two hands resting on the
	  desk or keyboard tray.  Such behavioral techniques may offer
	  far greater 	 potential for reducing injury than any
	  changes 	 in device 	 design.  	 But their use
	  may 	 also lead 	 to 	 further
	  injury, given that 	 they represent a very different
	  approach than that of 	 complete 	 rest.  For lesser
	  injuries, 	 other 	 techniques are 	 possible as
	  is discussed in 	 books 	 on 	 computer-induced
	  injuries.
	</p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, I believe that avoidance and technique are
	  more important than device design.  Avoidance can be achieved
	  by a combination of speech recognition and foot pedals.  I
	  doubt that there are any other ways that are comparable in
	  efficiency.
