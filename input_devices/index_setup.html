    billion people use keyboards.  They are an extraordinary proof of
    how the human brain effectively inferfaces a computer: through a
    set of symbols (keys).  ShortTalk is designed according to the
    same philosophy, making it several times more efficient than
    current speech user interfaces.

      <p>Here are some information about how I put my work
	  environment together.  For a picture of my workspace, see <a href='../index_uisummary.html'>User interface summary</a>.
	</p>
      <h3>Foot pedals</h3>
      <p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to buy appropriate foot
	keyboards.  Foot switches that just float around on the floor
	are a bad idea.  Your feet won't be able to find them—and
	using them frequently may induce cramps in calf muscles.  Foot
	switches should be mounted on a foot rest.  A Y-key dual
	keyboard adaptor (from <a href='http://www.ymouse.com/'>http://www.ymouse.com</a>)
	allows two keyboards to be used together.  Also, I believe
	that USB keyboards can be used in parallel.  In any case,
	individual foot switches can connected to the soldering points
	under each key on a second keyboard.  It's easiest to work
	with a keyboard equipped with mechanical switches, since
	capacitive switches may require the addition of a capacitor
	for each key.  The construction of a keyboard like the one
	shown probably can be done in a couple of days by somebody
	with electronic and woodworking skills.</p>
      <h3>Buttonless mice</h3>
      <p>
	  Under Windows 2000 and XP, it is easy to make several mice
	  work together.  Personally, my favorite "ergonomic" mouse is
	  a 10 dollar device from Sakar International (Model #77452,
	  Iconcepts).  It is small so that the hand does not have to
	  struggle mounting it, and it is not too rounded.  I have
	  disabled the mouse buttons by sliding two thin slices of
	  rubber in the gap between the button and the case.  A better
	  alternative is to reshape an optical mouse, by peeling off
	  the upper casing; a better surface for grasping the mouse
	  can then be built out of epoxy or modeling clay.
	  Electrically, an ordinary foot switch or an extra key
	  mounted on the keyboard over a micro switch may be used to
	  short-circuit the two contact points of the micro switch
	  serving a button inside the mouse.  Thus, with relatively
	  modest soldering skills, one can connect a mouse
	  button switch via a second mouse (that is used solely for
	  this purpose).  Under Windows 2000 and XP, it is possible to
	  press the button of one mouse, while moving the other mouse,
	  to achieve the effect of dragging.  This is not possible
	  under some other operating systems, including Windows 98 and
	  Me.
	</p>
      <p>There might be easier ways to obtain a buttonless
	mouse—I have not investigated alternatives.
	</p>
      <h3>Wireless microphone</h3>
      <p>I like the design of the wired
	Emkay D-loop microphone.  It is very comfortable to wear, and
	the microphone stays in place.  Unfortunately, I have not been
	too impressed with the wireless consumer solutions that I've
	tested.  Instead, I use a Shure LX wireless system.  The
	microphones that Shure provides come with elastic bands that
	wrap around your neck.  This a great solution for aerobics
	instructors—but an unworkable solution for speech
	recognition: you can't move your head without the microphone
	moving in front of your mouth.  Instead, I have connected an
	Emkay D-loop microphone to the mini-XLR connector.  The
	details are: connect shield to pin 1 and short-circuit pin 3
	and pin 2 (which carries 5 V) and connect the hot wire (red) or
	pair of hot wires (red and white) to that short (inspiration
	for this operation is the diagram found at <a href='http://www.shure.com/pdf/userguides/guides_wiredmics/wcm16.pdf'>http://www.shure.com/pdf/userguides/guides_wiredmics/wcm16.pdf</a>).
	To accomplish this wiring, I had to open the female mini-XLR
	connector.  To my knowledge, there is no mini-XLR to mini
	phone plug connector on the market.
	</p>
      <h3>Keyboard</h3>
      <p>I used to use an IBM keyboard without
	numeric keypad to gain space.  This excellent keyboard has
	mechanical switches and widely spaced Shft, Ctrl and Alt keys
	(IBM part no 1397681).  It is not made anymore.  My current
	keyboard is different, but since finally I am able to largely
	not use it, its design is not important.
	</p>
      <h3>Computer </h3>
      <p>In my experience, Pentium III processors
	  under 1 GHz are inadequate for speech recognition based on the
	  NaturallySpeaking dictation system, now produced by Scansoft.
	  It seems like some of some kind of “thrashing” (a technical
	  term of computer architecture) frequently occurs when a
	  response to even a short utterance takes several seconds
	  (perhaps, the L2 cache of the CPU is too small.)  The last six
	  months I have been using a AMD-based processor (Athlon 1.4
	  GHz) with extremely nice results: response time for short
	  utterances is very quick and the system altogether has been
	  very stable, even when slightly over-clocked (something that
	  is unnecessary).  I have no experience using Pentium IV
	  systems.
