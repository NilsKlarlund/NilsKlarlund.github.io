          <p>I am writing this essay to summarize my years of
	  experiments with input device design.  My interest is born
	  out of a long-lasting typing injury, but I have no formal
	  training in ergonomics.  I hope to provide a critical and
	  realistic view of what can be done to improve input devices.
	  The goal of course is to fundamentally reduce the strain on
	  hands and arms when using the computer.  It is actually
	  possible, I believe, to work in a fashion that is
	  dramatically easier on hands, arms, and shoulders.  There is
	  no miracle: it involves (1) speech recognition and mastery
	  of a system of voice commands (2) use of a reduced-impact
	  pointing device that may be shoved around by one or two
	  hands, and (3) a foot pedal arrangement.  
	</p>
          <p>
	  Neither of these techniques are commercially available; nor
	  have they been tested in long-term experiments by
	  others—the expensive and only way of establishing claims
	  of ergonomic superiority.  However, the proposals I present
	  have been subjected to my own daily usage for several years.
	  They represent but a fraction of ideas and commercial
	  products that I have attempted to use long-term.
	</p>
          <p>The main point of this essay is that input device design
	  is very difficult, even though there are often simple
	  explanations why a design is potentially injurious.  I will
	  give several examples of input device designs that are
	  superficially appealing, but seemingly devoid of functional
	  qualities that make them usable in ways that fundamentally
	  reduce physical stress.  Rather, by their very
	  construction, some alternative designs hold the potential of
	  being more harmful then the traditional designs they are
	  intending to replace.
	</p>
          <p>The patent literature is brimming with input device ideas.
	  Engineers, doctors, and lay people have investigated mouse
	  surface curvatures, twistings of the keyboard, wearable
	  gizmos, etc.  These initiatives apparently have had little
	  impact in reducing pain and injury from computer use.</p>
          <p>Even the popular "ergonomic" split keyboards have not been
	  shown to have any health benefits; a proof, if possible,
	  would involve long-term studies involving thousands of
	  individuals.  The theory that these keyboards are easier on
	  body because they involve less “deviation” of the hands
	  relative to the forearm is plausible.  But maybe more
	  plausible is the opposite hypothesis: what matters is only
	  how you use the keyboard.  Moreover, the opposite hypothesis
	  argues that since the standard keyboard is smaller it better
	  allows your hands to manipulate the mouse and to find a
	  resting position.  So, it is already clear that the
	  so-called “ergonomic” keyboards are “ergonomic” in name
	  only; they represent another compromise among a host of
	  competing design constraints.</p>
          <p>This kind of analytical
	  thinking about various stresses on the body incurred by use
	  of devices is important to anybody who is struggling with
	  pain from computing, since it is one way of raising body
	  awareness.  This is especially true since the innumerable
	  negative experiences with “ergonomic” equipment go
	  unreported.  Whether it be a speech recognition program or
	  an especially “ergonomic” mouse design, the technology is
	  usually disappointing. The defeat is not broadcast to
	  colleagues and friends.
	</p>
          <p>Why do keyboards and mice hurt people?  Nobody seems to
	  really know.  At a cellular level, the processes behind CTD
	  remain a mystery, although it is believed that inflammation
	  is not a necessary component, see <a href='http://www.tendinosis.org'>tendinosis.org</a> for
	  pointers to medical literature.  At the functional level, it
	  remains unproven that repetitive motion is to blame.  For
	  example, another functional culprit could be the constant
	  stress the body is experiencing when near the devices.</p>
          <p>To understand this, think about replacing each key on the
	  keyboard and each button on the mouse with a little hot
	  plate glowing red.  If you were working next to such a
	  monstrous instrument, then you would condition your limbs to
	  be constantly adjusting themselves so as not to touch any of
	  more than one hundred hot plates.  The point is, of course,
	  that even when keyboard and mouse do not posses thermal
	  properties, your body must be conditioned exactly the same
	  way.</p>
          <p>The mouse is particularly bad, since the hand tends to ride
	  it.  Consequently, fingers must be forced upwards to not
	  press the hot plates.<img align='right' src='../gifs/hand-on-mouse.gif' alt='Arrow showing static    stress force when using mouse'> Extensor muscles, the arms'
	  weakest ones, are continuously struggling to keep this
	  unnatural balance even if the brain thinks that the hand is
	  at rest.  Interestingly, preschool kids struggle quite a bit
	  with this likely injurious principle.  Whereas they may
	  easily learn to type out their own name on the keyboard, it
	  may take several more months for them to learn to hold the
	  mouse without pressing the buttons—an indication that the
	  mouse is anything but natural.</p>
          <p>In my judgement, there are three areas where new thinking
	  may lead to less pain when using a computer.  For the
	  keyboard, there is only little room for improvement—still
	  I have some modest ideas, see <a href='index_keyboard.html'>keyboard</a>.  In contrast,
	  the mouse may be an essentially harmful device that cannot
	  be improved within its traditional design constraints—see
	  my proposal in <a href='index_mouse.html'>mouse</a> for a
	  different concept.  Finally, I suggest how foot pedals can
	  very effectively complement a keyboard or speech recognition
	  for repetitive tasks in <a href='index_footpedals.html'>foot pedals</a>.</p>
          <p>My opinions and proposals are the result of a decade of
	  personal experimentation and observation.  That's why I call
	  this overview a "usage-driven approach".  The information I
	  offer here should not be construed as advice.  I do not know
	  whether my observations are generally applicable.  If you
	  have pain, then go see a doctor.  The only recommendation I
	  offer to others with typing or mouse injuries is to look in
	  the excellent book <em>Repetitive strain injury</em> by Emil
	  Pascarelli and Deborah Quilter (John Wiley and Sons, 1994).
