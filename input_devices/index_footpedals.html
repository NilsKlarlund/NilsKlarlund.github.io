                  of symbols that are unconsciously combined.  ShortTalk is designed

          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Obviously, foot pedals cannot replace the keyboard.  But it is
	  intriguing that many of us use our strongest limbs to control
	  safety-critical pedals while going to or from work, while the
	  same limbs stay underemployed under the desk all day.  The
	  problem is that using just two a three pedals as in the car
	  will not cover enough of repetitive work to make a difference.
	  For example, even processing incoming e-mail requires at least
	  five keys (next message, previous message, scroll down, scroll
	  up, and delete message).  And, naturally, typing with our feet
	  must be considered a hopeless task for most of us.
	</p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Speech recognition offers an excellent alternative to
	  typing, even as it seems hopeless at repetitive work.
	  Saying "page up", "page up", "page down" to browse through a
	  web page speaks for itself.  So, maybe the combination of
	  speech recognition and foot pedals is the combination that
	  will effectively offload the hands?
	</p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This was my thinking when I started using speech
	  recognition six years ago.  Initially, I used five or six
	  foot switches glued to a wooden board.  Through several
	  iterations of pedals arrangements, I arrived at a basic layout
	  that can be seen in the photos below.
	</p>
                
          <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="picture">
        <img src="../photos/footkeyboard1.jpg"/>
        <img src="../photos/footkeyboard2.jpg"/>

          	(For a technical disclosure, see 
          <a xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://www.delphion.com/details?pn=US05889510__">US5889510
	  Foot-operated keyboard device</a>) 

          	
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this design, each foot may operate seven front keys
	  placed around the sides and front of the foot.  Most common
	  keys are present: the arrow keys, enter, backspace, space, and
	  tab. In addition, left and right mouse buttons are present
	  (see <a href="index_mouse.html">mouse</a> why this is
	  important).  Also, there are an undo key and three keys
	  important to speech recognition: repeat last voice command,
	  correction, and microphone on/off.  All of these keys are
	  commonly used.  But 14 keys don't suffice.  So, other common
	  functions such as "page up", "skip over left word", "change
	  window focus", "go to the beginning of line" and "go to end of
	  document" are activated through a combination of a front key
	  and one of two modifier keys behind the foot.  The idea is to
	  step forward on a front key with one foot while the heel of
	  the other presses the modifier.  The modifier pedals are
	  two-level switches, so altogether the keyboard offers 14 * 5 =
	  70 foot-activated functions.  A <a href="../video/footkeyboard.wmv">video</a> (streaming Windows
	  Media) (<a href="../video/footkeyboard.mpg">mpeg-1</a>
	  (28Mb)) of a version of this keyboard is available.
	</p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The design shown here is crude; it is possible to devise
	  much better working key shapes.
	</p>
                
          <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I have used this design for four years.  In my experience, the
	  combination of speech recognition, based on the editing
	  language <a href="ShortTalk.html">ShortTalk</a>, buttonless
	  mouse, and foot pedals is significantly more efficient than
	  the keyboard + mouse combination.  This efficiency is
	  important: it is <em>the</em> driving force for using the
	  combination.  It is extremely difficult not to work in one's
	  old ways if the new ways are not superior.
