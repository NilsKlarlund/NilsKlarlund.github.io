    <h1>Progress measures</h1>


     
	<p>How can one prove properties about infinite limitations by
	looking at the finite ones?  To study this question, I
	formulated in my thesis (<span class="papertitle">Progress
	measures and finite arguments for infinite
	computations</span>, Cornell University, 1990) ways of viewing
	infinite limitations as limits of finite ones.  In particular,
	I showed how one can directly quantify progress towards
	membership in various sets of the Borel hierarchy through
	<em>progress measures</em>, which are arrangements of
	ordinals.  After my thesis, I applied these techniques to show
	that certain tree automata can be complemented in exponential
	space, instead of doubly-exponential space; this result means
	that the lower bound, established by Meyer, for the logic S2S
	of an one exponential increase in complexity per quantifer
	alternation is also an upper bound.  The progress measures
	also summarize in one mathematical entity earlier program
	transformation techniques for reasoning about termination
	under fairness conditions.
